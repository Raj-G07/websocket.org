## Writing Guidelines

### Content Structure

- **Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials and explanations
- **Reference**: Technical specifications and API documentation
- **Resources**: Links, tools, and community resources
- **Tools**: Interactive tools and utilities

### Markdown Guidelines

When creating content pages:

- **DO NOT** add a top-level heading (`# Title`) - the page title is
  automatically generated from the frontmatter
- Start with frontmatter containing `title` and `description`
- Use heading levels starting from `## H2` for sections
- Include code examples where relevant
- Add links to related content

Example:

```markdown
---
title: Your Page Title
description: A brief description of the page content
---

Start your content here without adding # Your Page Title again.

## First Section

Your content...
```

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Include meaningful variable and function names
- Add TypeScript types where applicable

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
