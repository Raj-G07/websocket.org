# Once Upon a Socket â€” A (Mostly) True Love Story of the Realtime Web

## Complete Storybook Content (All 18 Pages)

### Page 1 - Cover
**Text:** 
"In the beginning, there was the Web. And it was... static. A world of quiet, unchanging pages. Our hero, the Client, a brave little web browser, could only ask for things. 'May I have this page, Sir Server?' he'd politely inquire."

### Page 2 - The Server Responds
**Text:** 
"And across the digital divide, the mighty Server, a stoic and powerful machine, would grant his request. He'd dutifully package up an HTML file and send it over. 'Here you are, little one. Do enjoy.' And then... silence."

### Page 3 - The Way of Things
**Text:** 
"This was the way of things. A world of 'Request' and 'Response.' It was reliable, yes, but oh-so-slow. The Client longed for more. He dreamt of a world where he didn't have to ask for every single update. 'There must be a better way!' he cried into the void."

### Page 4 - AJAX Arrives
**Text:** 
"Then came a spark of genius! A clever trick called AJAX. It was like a secret agent, fetching tiny bits of data without reloading the whole page. 'Psst, Server,' the Client would whisper, 'just a little update, if you please.'"

### Page 5 - Not True Love
**Text:** 
"The Server, ever accommodating, would oblige. But even this was not true love. It was a series of clandestine meetings, a flurry of short, whispered messages. The connection was never truly... open."

### Page 6 - Comet
**Text:** 
"The longing for a real connection grew. And so, the clever developers of the world devised a new plan: Comet! It was a brave, if slightly desperate, attempt to keep the line open. The Client would make a request and the Server would... just... hold on. For a really, really long time."
